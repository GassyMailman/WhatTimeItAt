# WhatTimeItAt
What I wanted:
A website that tells you the time and gives you some motivation to start your day off.
It was basically a glorified alarm clock.
In the end i wanted people to also be able to make an account and be able to set reminders for themselves.

Why:
Pretty much my only motivation for making this was because it was a project.
I also couldn't come up with some super cool idea for a website so i thought i'd make something so unneeded and simple.

Unique?:
Can you think of an alarm that tells you a motivational quote when you ask?
Yea didn't think so.

What is used to make:
The programs i used were HTML, CSS, Java and in the end started with PHP

Challenges:
Main challenge was relearning all the things i since i hadn't used most of these programs since sophomore year.
My other challenge was making the random quotes come up with the click of a button. Turns out it was super easy and i'm just an idiot.

What I've done:
Time
Current weather in the area
Button that gives you 1 out of 28 random motivational quotes
Made it a one page website
Have auto scrolling features
Background clock noise
Bacon button
Section about the website
A feature i ended up adding that wasn't planned was the auto scroll feature.

What i didn't do:
I was never able to get the login working and setting reminders.
